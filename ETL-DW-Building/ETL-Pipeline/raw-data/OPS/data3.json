For example, the disclosed systems utilize past outputs from a past state of a student network with outputs of a teacher network to compose student-regularized teacher outputs that regularize training targets by making the training targets similar to student outputs while preserving semantics from the teacher training targets. Additionally, the disclosed systems utilize the student-regularized teacher outputs with student outputs of the present states to generate retrospective knowledge distillation losses. Then, in one or more implementations, the disclosed systems compound the retrospective knowledge distillation losses with other losses of the student network outputs determined on the main training tasks to learn parameters of the student networks.",

A trunk network in a teacher network model and a student network model outputs a dense feature graph, a classifier outputs a class probability graph, then a distillation loss function is determined based on the dense feature graph and the class probability graph, and finally iterative training is performed on the student network model based on the distillation loss function to obtain a maturely trained student network model. The student model is guided to learn more discriminative inter-sample difference knowledge of the teacher model from pixel and category dimensions through knowledge distillation, so that a more comprehensive and detailed spatial dependency relationship is captured, and the road scene segmentation capability of the model is remarkably improved.",

In video modal learning, an FCN-based multi-resolution network is designed to extract attitude features, and a local self-attention network is applied to a generated thermodynamic diagram to adaptively adjust weights and attention of different regions so as to capture finer key point information. In CSI modal learning, a spatial position linear change layer based on a space-time attention network and guided by multiple modes is designed to meet self-learning of space-time features. In the whole multi-mode learning network, a teacher-student architecture is adopted, so that the posture estimation model based on the Wi-Fi signal can learn more deep learning capability of a video mode. Correct information of human body posture estimation is transferred from a video learning network to a Wi-Fi signal learning network, and finally human body posture information can be accurately estimated only by inputting a CSI mode.",

The method comprises training a teacher model locally at each node and then moving each of the teacher models to a central node and using these to train a student model using a transfer dataset. This may be facilitated by setting up the cloud service using inter-region peering connections between the nodes to make the nodes appear as a single cluster. In one variation the student module may be trained at each node using the multiple trained teacher models. In another variation we train multiple student models where each student model is trained by each teacher model at the node the teacher model was trained on, and once the plurality of student models are trained, an ensemble model is generated from the plurality of trained student models.

The exemplary LSTN module also features significant properties that automate the continuous development and integration of deep learning models by (1) learning to synthesize annotated data given only a few samples of the target objects, (2) continuously increasing the object set by adding newly detected objects via an annotation network and (3) supporting the training of the end-model to be released at edge devices via knowledge transfer using a distillation approach by following a Teacher-Student scheme.

The method includes training teacher models locally at each node, then moving each teacher model to a central node and using them to train student models using a migration data set. By using inter-region peer-to-peer connections between nodes to set up cloud services such that these nodes appear in a single cluster, this is facilitated. In one variant, student modules may be trained at each node using a plurality of trained teacher models. In another variant, a plurality of student models are trained, where each student model is trained by each teacher model at its trained node, and once the plurality of student models are trained, an ensemble model is generated from the plurality of trained student models. Load balancing may be achieved using loss function weighting and node downsampling to improve accuracy and time/cost efficiency.",

According to the method, a wrong question set is set to store integrated output characteristics in the network training process of students, and whether the integrated output characteristics recorded in the wrong question set are correct or not is judged through real labels of training pictures; and if the recorded features are wrong, updating the network parameters to enable the distribution of the output features zi of each network in the network set to be close to the feature distribution recorded in the error question set, and if the recorded features are wrong, enabling the distribution of zi to be far away from the feature distribution recorded in the error question set. That is to say, historical information integrated and output by a network set is stored by using an error question set and is used as supervision information for student network optimization training, and a reflection mechanism is proposed to enable output distribution of a student network to be far away from wrong historical information and close to correct historical information, so that the student network is forced to learn better features, and the learning efficiency is improved. Therefore, a more accurate classification result is obtained when the image is classified.",

The method comprises training a teacher model locally at each node and then moving each of the teacher models to a central node and using these to train a student model using a transfer dataset. This may be facilitated by setting up the cloud service using inter-region peering connections between the nodes to make the nodes appear as a single cluster. In one variation the student module may be trained at each node using the multiple trained teacher models. In another variation we train multiple student models where each student model is trained by each teacher model at the node the teacher model was trained on, and once the plurality of student models are trained, an ensemble model is generated from the plurality of trained student models. Loss function weighting and node under sampling to enable load balancing may be used to improve accuracy and time/cost efficiency.",

The success of deep learning mainly depends on a large-scale tagged data set. Most of data sets are manually labeled, so that the labeling accuracy is difficult to guarantee. Therefore, noise tags are inevitable in a real-world data set. Due to the strong learning ability of the deep neural network, the noise label is very easy to over-fit, and the model performance is reduced. In order to solve the problem, the invention provides a teacher-student structure based on feature space reformation, and the teacher-student structure is used for learning noise labels. A teacher model is trained to correct noise labels for student models. A feature space reforming mechanism is applied to guide a student model to carry out self-learning, so that the student model learns more meaningful information. We assess our methods on the three reference data sets. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.",

The problems of wrong exercises being relatively singular in existing wrong exercise recommendation and the quality pertinence of wrong exercise recommendation not being high are solved. Personalized recommended practice exercises can be automatically generated with regard to the work situations and knowledge point mastering situations of students, so that the students spend time on exercises which need to be practiced the most, thereby helping the students to learn efficiently, and the exercise completion time can thus be reduced, thereby achieving the aims of performing personalized learning and improving the learning efficiency.",

The teacher who wants to set a question paper first logs on to the Exam manager application and does the same. The student who wants to take up the examination logs into the virtual scribe application and is first authenticated through facial authentication, passing which the exam session is started automatically. The student then interacts with the virtual scribe using simple voice commands, which has a minimal learning curve. The student answers the questions using speech which is then converted into text using Speech Recognition technologies. Upon completion of the paper, the answers given by the student are automatically saved into the database. The teacher can view each of these responses in PDF format using the Exam Manager application.

As the teacher starts to call out the roll the teachers face is always faced down on the attendance sheet, now as the names are called the students reply to their names to get the attendance for that subject. Now let us assume that 'student a' is not in class and his friend 'student b' is in class. When the name of 'student a' is called, 'student b' will answer in his place and the teacher will not know if it was actually 'student a' because the teacher is focused on the attendance sheet, and 'student a' will get away with a free attendance. So this is where our project comes into picture to counter this problem. Our project is based on the attendance that can be given to students more effectively and conveniently so as to eliminate any human error and labor and make it easier for teachers to provide attendance to the students. We started off with planning a system where the students will be given an RFID and then we would make a receiver to detect the ID and then provide the attendance. The receiver would be placed inside the class where it would be activated only with the consent of the concerned faculty. This way we can reduce the burden of the teachers to take attendance at the start of the class. But then we realized that this system has some flaws, for example if the receiver is activated at that time and when the student swipes the card twice it will provide the attendance for two days and if the student was carrying his ID as well as his friends ID he could easily provide the attendance for his friend, which is no equal to the first case where the teacher would take the attendance manually.

        "abstract_text": "A decentralised training platform is described for training an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model where training data (e.g. medical images) is distributed across multiple sites (nodes) and due to confidentiality, legal, or other reasons the data at each site is unable to be shared or leave the site and so cannot be copied to a central location for training. The method comprises training a teacher model locally at each node and then moving each of the teacher models to a central node and using these to train a student model using a transfer dataset. This may be facilitated by setting up the cloud service using inter-region peering connections between the nodes to make the nodes appear as a single cluster. In one variation the student module may be trained at each node using the multiple trained teacher models. In another variation we train multiple student models where each student model is trained by each teacher model at the node the teacher model was trained on, and once the plurality of student models are trained, an ensemble model is generated from the plurality of trained student models. Loss function weighting and node under sampling to enable load balancing may be used to improve accuracy and time/cost efficiency.",

An overall optimization target (cross entropy loss, pixel distillation loss, paired distillation loss and overall distillation loss) is continuously optimized. Finally, the number of parameters of the student network obtained through distillation is greatly reduced and the forward calculation time of the network is greatly reduced under the condition that the student network obtainedthrough distillation meets extremely small reduction of IEU (Interoperability Union).

For example, if a student accesses a wireless router that is in the same physical location as a class on the student's schedule at the time the class takes place, the correlated time and place quantifies how the student behaves with respect to class attendance. The invention takes the sum of such interactions (e.g., attending classes, studying in the library, etc.) and produces a student engagement score (SES) for each student.

Accordingly, in on-line course offerings, even large numbers of students and student submissions may be accommodated in a scalable and uniform grading or scoring scheme.

The method may facilitate student interaction within given subject areas. The method & system may employ artificial intelligence in that it may monitor a student's moral and/or motivation while studying a given a subject. As such. the system may detect a dip in moral by assessing several parameters surrounding the answering of one or more questions. The system may, in turn, seek to increase moral by feeding that student easier questions or questions which are deemed to be of a subject area in which the student is proficient. The system may take countermeasures if a student is demonstrating high proficiency in a subject.",

The reading tutoring system includes immediate feedback data provided to the student and including an indicator reflective of the student's reading comprehension and the identity of the instructional passage that the student should read next. An automated, computer-based method of reading tutoring comprises the steps of receiving a student-submitted summary of a selected instructional passage from a domain of discourse, automatically evaluating the summary to obtain a measure of the student's reading comprehension and, based on this evaluation, automatically selecting an instructional passage for the student to read next.",

The method includes the steps of receiving an input from a user solving a problem and determining if the input violates at least one consistency rule. The consistency rules are rules implemented to allow a constraint of the input to be evaluated and compared to a fundamental rule set for the problem. The fundamental rule set includes a plurality of principles that impose the constraints on a resulting solution. A student's mistake is applied to the consistency rules to allow the artificial intelligence program to respond to the answer by either providing a necessary principle overlooked by the student, or allows the program to, at a minimum, generate feedback to say something educationally useful to the student. This can be done even when buggy rules have failed to match and provide a rationale for the mistake.",

        "abstract_text": "An automated, computer-based reading tutoring system is accessed via a computer system and includes a plurality of instructional passages of different, predetermined levels of reading difficulty. A semantic space modu le of the reading tutoring system operates on a semantic space, which is produc ed by a machine-learning method, to automatically evaluate a student-submitted summary of a selected instructional passage for congruence with the selected instructional passage and to automatically determine which instructional passage the student should optimally read next. The reading tutoring system includes immediate feedback data provided to the student and including an indicator reflective of the student's reading comprehension and the identity of the instructional passagd that the student should read next. An automated , computer-based method of reading tutoring comprises the steps of receiving a student-submitted summary of a selected instructional passage from a domain of discourse, automatically evaluating the summary to obtain a measure of the student's reading comprehension and, based on this evaluation, automatically selecting an instructional passage for the student to read next.",

It is a managed distance learning system which comprises three inventive steps to facilitate distance learning; 2.) The three inventive steps in summary are: a.) A meaning parser; b.) A lexical analyzer; c.) A course development module; 3.) These steps allow a student to write a test in an expanded sub-set beyon d true-false or multiple choice by allowing narrative whereby the invention is able to grade the student's retention of the subject matter utilizing basic artificial intelligence; 4.) The course development module allows a teacher to create course content simply and effectively utilizing Windows 95, 98, 2000 or NT; 5.) The first step involves a teacher producing course content with his or h er personality stamped thereon within the parameters of instruction or parameters of informational dissemination set by the sponsoring body whether it be educational, corporat e, university level, professional body or commercial; 6.) The second step involves the student, learner or consumer responding in narrative form whether by E-mail, VOIP or telephone with voice recognition technology to answer a question beyond the simple true-false or multiple choice sub-set; 7.)
