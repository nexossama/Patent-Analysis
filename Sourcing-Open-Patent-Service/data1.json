The present teaching may also or instead include a time-series analysis including at least one of: (i) calculating recurrence-based quantification, such as, but not limited to, recurrence rate, determinism, and laminarity; (ii) calculating the optimal recurrence threshold based on maximum variations of the system's determinism and degree of predictability; and (iii) calculating complexity-based measures such as permutation entropy. Such analyses may be used to detect, inter-alia, sleep apnea syndrome.",

Based on the states and the aging term, the machine learning agent determines a set of actions that are applied to the control system. Subsequently, the machine learning agent can extract a new set of states to analyze the efficacy of the set of actions. This is achieved through an optimality function that quantifies the success of the set of actions by calculating an optimality score. The calculation is based on both a current performance of the system and a future drift or degradation of system components. Through many iterations of the action set, the machine learning agent can optimize system operations.",

To achieve this, the machine learning agent extracts a set of states and an aging model from the control system and derives an aging term from the aging model. Based on the states and the aging term, the machine learning agent determines a set of actions that are applied to the control system. Subsequently, the machine learning agent can extract a new set of states to analyze the efficacy of the set of actions. This is achieved through an optimality function that quantifies the success of the set of actions by calculating an optimality score. The calculation is based on both a current performance of the system and a future drift or degradation of system components. Through many iterations of the action set, the machine learning agent can optimize system operations.",

If it is systematized, it will be fastest inspired by organs such as eyes, ears and tongue. In the sense of sound, it was God who unified the language. Until later, because of abandoning teaching, human language becomes confounded. However, the development of natural language has never been stopped for a moment. The use of natural language idioms is the most natural way of expression and communication, requiring no skills and any form. When the language becomes a civilization across generations, the use of idioms gradually develops towards secularization and regionalization. In the human natural language, the application of adverbs often adopts idioms. Adverbs are attached before and after verbs and nouns. In the expression of natural language in artificial intelligence, there exists discussion such as \"interrogative adverbs\" and \"relational adverbs\". For the relational word system of the predicate structure of \"who-where-when-why-what\", see the description in Table 1 of \"claims\" for details. Since the main sentences, clauses, and predicates of artificial intelligence are inseparable from the adverb grammar and adverbs also cannot be separated from the existing environment, they naturally become general grammar. \"Who-where-when-why-what\" are widely used in the daily-life natural language and involve the rules of life experience, so it is more convenient to use. There are no obstacles when communicating with each other, and it is easy to understand the original meaning. AI artificial intelligence has always used symbols. The coding in the program is used as a semantic expression and tool, and of course punctuation is often used. These are the conventions of AI program coding, and when relevant definitions are established they must be formalized in order to be used smoothly. For the above semantic coding, see AI semantic coding in Table 2 of \"description\" 003. The subject matter of the present invention is 004 \"Natural language predicates on multi-chip circuit logic layout\".",

Technology in classroom was seen as one of the supplementary learning tools in education. Physical Schools and educational institutions held governance of student teaching & learning. Home schooling was seen in the dim light of educational progress towards sustenance. While Design Learning (DL) and outcome-based approach gained prominence, the Design Learning (DL) methods have been comprehensively used in various regions, there by assisting in teaching, learning, evaluation, and outcome-based assessment.

The current study would reveal the variables that are critical to effective technology-based learning of the students. The implications generated through the study would allow the institution involved in the study to effectively implement the variables required for enhanced teaching and learning with the use of a mobile application. The methodology used in the study was an exploratory study combined with a survey as a quantitative method through the mobile application. Various machine learning algorithms can be applied for studying how independent variables incorporated in the eDify mobile application are affecting the result of the teaching learning process. The Principal component analysis(PCA) and a range of regression analyses are conducted to test the relationships between the independent and the dependent variable \"learning experience\". With Principle component analysis results the evaluation parameters can be reduced for optimized results. Results suggest that the usability variables positively and significantly affect the learning experience's dependent variable. SHEET 5 OF 5 TOTAL NO.

When the data for model construction changes, the machine learning model that is constructed may change, yet exact identification with high probability should still be possible, so that there is high probability for a mislabeled sample that the original label and the identification result do not match and misidentification results. When the number of times this misidentification occurs is counted for each sample and a misidentification rate is obtained, it is found that a misidentification rate is relatively high for mislabeled samples, so a mislabeled sample is specified on the basis of the misidentification rate (S6-S7). Thus, it is possible to improve the performance of identifying a machine learning model by detecting a sample with high accuracy that is included in the teaching data and very likely to have been mislabeled.",

As for a certain part of the solar atmosphere, the data coming from observation satellites and ground-based devices are not available or are partially available. The utility model provides simulation of this part of the solar atmosphere, in order to visualize the entire solar atmosphere in an online stereo 3D environment. Deep learning is used in order to implement the simulation, as it is hardware implemented through graphics processing units - GPUs (GPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The system for online stereo 3D-visualization of the solar atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 1 receives input information through the input data interface unit (1) relating to the solar atmosphere. This data is processed continuously and in real time by a neural network learning unit using GRU hardware (2), as the latter creates and continuously improves the current neural network model (3). At the same time, the FGA-based output machine (4) simulates the state of the entire solar atmosphere based on the current neural network model (3) and the information received from the input data interface unit (1) relating to the solar atmosphere. The simulated state of the entire solar atmosphere enters a server to generate a 3D model of the solar atmosphere (5), which is connected to the Internet. The user workstations, representing personal devices with a web interface(7I...7n), are connected to the server (5) via the Internet environment. The application is in online stereo 3D-visualization of the solar atmosphere aimed at teaching Solar-terrestrial Physics to students and PhD students at universities and research institutes.

Then, an input dimension to be nullified is determined using a threshold determined by a gaussian distribution function based on the degree of contribution (S3-S5). Machine learning that uses teaching data with some input dimensions nullified is executed again (S6), the degree of contribution per input dimension is found from the obtained learning model, and the degree of contribution is updated on the basis of old and new degrees of contribution (S7-S8). The process of steps S5-S8 is repeated a designated number of times (S9), and a machine learning model is constructed after determining useful input dimensions on the basis of the final degree of contribution (S10).SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 3",

To improve efficacy over time, rules may be periodically amended by a user during the initial training stage or after rules have been generated. In this fashion, classification rules may evolve, thereby improving the accuracy and speed of the classification process. Classification rules are also presented in a human-readable format, thereby improving the transparency of the classification process and facilitating the interaction between the system and the administrator.",

        "abstract_text": "A system is disclosed that provides an interactive rewards-based method that uses a protocol for instructional response in order to provide a motivating, individualized educational and entertaining experience. The system utilizes an interface through a computer. The system offers the user (a.k.a. student) simulated environments that represent different realities and an opportunity to solve interesting problems and learning puzzles. When the user inputs a response this calls forth a system response using the built-in Intelligent Mentor, thereby teaching the user. The iterative response process provides the user opportunities to discovery before proceeding to a higher level of the subject material. The pedagogical system uses neural nets (engine of artificial intelligence) that drive responses that are synchronized to typographical and graphical illustrations and/or pictorial illustrations used to simulate reality and to provide dynamic interactions. Stages of progression are integrated into the pedagogical system in order to provide users with individually paced experiences determined by the level of difficulty and rate of performance per time period. Users' interaction involves real-time decision-making and fusion of the educational material. It involves programs in computer medium that create a rewards-based system to provide a motivating educational and/or entertainment environment including natural attractions that further motivate continuous involvement in the learning process. Encoded lessons are enabled in the system that provide feedback on aspects of user performance such as mission management, mathematical solutions, recognition, matching, and utilizing data to solve problems and puzzles. The user receives credits each time he/she successfully completes a section. Credits are additive and may be exchanged for material rewards by using this invention of the \"virtual mall\" for the computer network. The rewards redemption system includes a server in communication with the users computer mechanism to form a network that may include the Internet. The credits may be saved or can be exchanged for material reward certificates. If redeemed, the student player is dispensed a specific verifiable reward acknowledgement. The computer system can also provide for competition games played for a rivalry of credits by a number of users. Reward information, such as reward costs in terms of specific credit redemption is automatically determined by the system. While this invention has been described in terms of several embodiments, it is contemplated that alterations, variations and equivalents thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art of pedagogy upon a reading of the specification and study of the drawings. For example, many types of problems/solution sets and puzzles can be provided for use with the disclosed rewards based system, and the computer tool can be utilized for classroom teaching as well. Thus variations can be used. It is noted that the rewards-based system of redemption can be implemented on a single computer connected to other computers, with or without use of the Internet. However, the preferred embodiment illustrated here envisions that the invention will be used in a broad network such as the Internet. The provision of rewards can be achieved by redemption certificates or electronically. It is therefore intended that the claims include all such alterations, variations, and equivalents as fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention. This rewards-based pedagogical system offering lessons within simulated environments and providing for various reward redemptions represents advancement in pedagogical systems for computer-assisted learning and paradigms of progressive skill-development.",

CONSTITUTION:The posture control coordinate systems Xj', Yj' and Zj' where the Xj' (j=1, 2, 3) axis, a Yj' axis and a Zj' are decided in the normal line direction of an arc locus, the tangent line direction and the direction vertical to the Xj' and Yj' planes respectively are set the teaching points P1, P2 and P3 of the arc locus respectively. Here the posture vectors of a tool are defined as a1, a2 and a3 at the teaching points P1-P3 which are shown in the robot coordinate system X0Y0Z0 fixed to a robot main body are expressed in the posture control coordinate systems Xj', Yj' and Zj'. Thus, posture vectors a1', a2' and a3' are defined. Then, the vectors a1'-a3' are divided on a fan-shaped plane decided by said two types of vectors as well as on a fan-shaped plane decided by vectors a1' and -a2' and vectors a2' and -a3'. Thus a vector ai' is obtained at an optional time point. Furthermore the vector ai' is converted into a posture vector ai in the system X0Y0Z0 and each axis of the robot 1 is controlled based on the vector ai.",
