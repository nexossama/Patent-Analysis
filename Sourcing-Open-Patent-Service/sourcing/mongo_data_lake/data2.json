        "abstract_text": "An Al-Based System for Diagnosis and Treatment of Mental Illness When it comes fulfilling the capacities of an individual in terms of psychological support and intervention the lag is evident. The huge stigma attached to the psychological issues/mental illnesses makes it all the more difficult for the population all over the world to go and approach the psychologists/psychiatrists. In addition to stigma, population is unaware of psychological signs/symptoms and emergency interventions related to psychiatric disorders. Henceforth, need of an artificial intelligence system which interacts with people about their psychological symptoms was seen. This is an inbuilt system based on Al which allows the user to express their needs and wants in a single platform. The application performs the functions from diagnosing to treating the user. Surely there are many unnoticed cases of mental illnesses which haven't been reported. The stigma attached to the mental illnesses makes it all the more difficult for the people to approach psychiatrists/therapists. This application will help the people to approach for treatment without facing any social stigma. Which in turn will help to develop a much transparent database for the same. The data base can be accessed by the Governmental Organisations to develop statistical data on the prevalence and occurrence of all psychological illnesses. Patients who are already under treatment can use the app for further interventions. Unlike other apps available in the market this app is completely Al based. How they feel, for how long are the symptoms running and further helps them track down their ongoing mental health conditions. The system will update/improve system based on latest researches and updates. The patient will be diagnosed according to their symptoms. The responses will be recorded and user will be suggested for further interventions. The recording of the response will further help in improving the quality of diagnoses. The sensors and camera of the laptop/ smart phones will be utilised to sense the emotions and vitals of the patient. The application will be connected to the smart watch also to configure the vitals of the users. Automated suggestions based on the present recorded condition of the user will pop up. For example, a pop up for breathing exercises, medicines. Time scheduled for therapies. Ongoing patients can enter their details and can continue with the treatment online. This in turn will help both the new and old patients to utilise the application. An approach to multiple health applications have been a part of the daily lives of the people. We have applications to talk to physicians, take appointment, applications taking care of our physical health have always been an emphasis.Apps taking care of our menstrual health, physical activities, diet planning, less is the area explored for mental illnesses/issues. An empty space was observed in the approach towards mental health. During the pandemic the lag was realisedon a greater wave length. When people were all locked inside their homes without an interaction with the outer world. When the population could not help themselves but be in the situation. It took months for the situations to normalise. Some might have had a good environment at home, some may not. Some might already be suffering from mental illnesses. Some might have been addicted to alcohol/drugs. Looking into the history of pandemics, we see that there was a rise of mental illnesses then and now with COVID-19. There have been reported rise in the cases of mental illnesses. People already suffering from the illnesses had no space to approach and contact psychiatrists. People who never had any symptom also gained anxiety and panic disorder as a result of the lockdown. Further the patients will get suggestions for virtual therapy and treatment sessions which they can go through from the same interface. Therapies earlier have been a separate part of the applications which either have been specified to anxiety and depression or just an app with therapies and consultations available. This invention will allow the user to go through the complete procedure at one go. The therapies again based on Al will be provided virtually. The application will register the timings and dosage of the drugs and therapies. The application will then buzz the user for their drug and therapy.Data will be gathered from the patient for the ongoing treatment and therapies or any other possible intervention that the patient is already going through or applied for the present psychological condition. The Al will take the feedback and suggest improvements on the ongoing interventions. The complete information will then be converted into a database which in turn will be utilised into the statistical information. This information can be processed into valuable data's that the organisations and governments can utilise for further interventional purposes. The prevalence of mental health issues in the community at all levels can be recognised easily. Since mental illnesses are associated with taboos in the society that people who earlier might be not in the count of the statistical data will now be part of the complete analysis of the data. The application will be helpful in taking out the real statistical data of the population. Usually, we only consider what is into account, and cannot go into the real data. People can easily be tracked and intervened for their condition. Early intervention can easily be possible for the suffering populations or the people who are unaware of the things. This application will in turn create awareness by giving health education tips and ideas for new and latest treatments for people.

Web Page prediction (WPP) is a classification issue in which the prediction of web pages is accomplished that a user may visit according to the knowledge of the formerly visited pages. WPP problem can be extended and implemented to reduce the access time while surfing the websites. The need to anticipate the needs of the website users to improve accessibility and user engagement is more than apparent now a day. Association rule mining is one of the most significant fields in data mining and knowledge discovery in databases. This concept plans to implement a new web page prediction model using an improved machine learning algorithm. The proposed web page prediction involves three phases (a) Rule Mining, (b) Optimal Rule Selection, and (c) Prediction. Initially, the collected web data is subjected to rule mining process. It is performed using the renowned association rule mining called Apriori algorithm, which is adopted for mining the frequent item set and association rule learning over relational databases. The length of the rule extracted from the Apriori algorithm is long, and it is needed to be reduced for performing the prediction with unique informative rules. Hence, the optimal rule selection is adopted, which uses the hybrid optimization algorithm with the integration of Deer Hunting Optimization Algorithm (DHOA) and Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO) called Deer Hunting Rooster-based CSO (DR-CSO). Further, the optimally selected rules are subjected to the Machine learning algorithm named Neural Network (NN) for predicting the browsing behavior of the user. Along with the optimal rule extraction, the proposed DR-CSO is used for performing the training in NN. The experimental and comparative results will prove the efficiency of the developed model over existing algorithms.

In order to develop a deep learning model receiving a random image and generating a phase hologram corresponding to the same, a learning method using the hyperbolic tangent function and the Parseval identical equation is developed. According to the present invention, in order to generate a phase hologram with deep learning, a learning method to which an optical property of the phase hologram is reflected is developed. In order to remove the periodicity of the phase hologram generated with the deep learning model, the hyperbolic tangent function is normalized within a range of (-1,1) to be formed into a one-to-one function. Also, since the accuracy of the phase hologram is not easy to evaluate due to its meaningless form, the phase hologram is restored into a preferred image and normalized, and then, an error with an original image is calculated. Here, in order to prevent a confusion caused by the normalization, the restored image is normalized with a Parseval coefficient set on every image. As the phase hologram is generated with deep learning, time required for the generation of the phase hologram can be considerably reduced. Therefore, a three-dimensional image can be reproduced in real time in a three-dimensional image platform such as AR/VR or the like. Therethrough, a new chapter of various content markets based on three-dimensional images such as culture, education, art and the like can be started.",

A sound collector is introduced into a school lecture room. Voiceprints of the school children and the teachers are registered in advance, and minutes of utterances are created by voice recognition. Feelings which can be estimated from the number of utterances and voices at a voice analysis are recorded, and a distribution to a lecture participation and an argument is digitalized by natural language processing. Score evaluations by the digitalized lessen data of the school children and feelings of the teachers are accumulated as big data, and the big data are used as training data which are necessary for a determination process of the artificial intelligence. The accuracy of the analogical reasoning of the artificial intelligence is enhanced, and made to further approximate an expert determination which is performed by the teacher, and a genus evaluation method depending on a teacher individual is changed to a standardized and equal evaluation method. By automating the evaluation of the school children, human resources of the school teachers are saved.SELECTED DRAWING: None",

        "abstract_text": "Legal language is difficult for the general public to understand and make popular education unreachable. When legal disputes occur, the judges and attorneys need to search the database of legal judgments to obtain the experience of dispute decision. However, human beings cannot read a large number of judgments within a limited period of time. It is also impossible for the general public to use limited keywords to do legal research. Since the search of verdicts and keywords requires professional skills and experience. This invention proposes a big data analysis, prediction, and graph display system for legal documents. We use artificial intelligence to search and study a large number of laws, regulations, orders, and even more than ten million judgments, and etc. When the general public users input information, the invention will statistically analyze all relevant laws, regulations and related judgments. This invention will show the result in a simple image table. This invention is not to replace the work of the legal profession, but to help the general public to know more about the laws, regulations and legal practice in Taiwan or Mainland China. The general public can save time and money through predicting possible litigation directions and results. People can decide whether to initiate litigation more easily. This invention can be used by law firms, courts, and even all citizens. Visualization of the legal data makes laws easy to understand and accelerates the proliferation of legal knowledge. This invention also provides the corresponding application platform in modern mobile device.",

Nowadays, parents pay more attention to early education and preschool education for fetus and newborns, the education for teenagers or all human beings never ends, but the self condition and the environment condition are usually ignored during education, such as the condition that the respiratory disease is caused to the newborns due to the fact that polyester fiber and fine hair in the air can be easily inhaled by the newborns who have no nose hair. By means of the system, environment renovation is integrated with education and leaning, for example, the education resources of the newborns are renewed through a network, space is purified in real time or the states of the newborns are monitored in real time; accordingly, the newborns get early education in a safe and comfortable environment. By means of the system, user space resources are saved, object management is facilitated, convenience is brought to life of people, an education and learning interaction platform is provided for people, and the safe and comfortable education and leaning environment is further provided for people.",

Neural Links that are connected wirelessly control via modem and/or cellular phone that connect wirelessly to any and all robots/mechanical/prosthetics/exoskeleton/backpack computing processor and memory/ipod any and all electronic devices/multiscreens computers/machines... Other means of control and Neural Links done wirelessly (between the Human Neural Links end and the robot/machine end possibly linked with one or more Artificial Intelligence) include: mobile network/wireless/router/cordless phone/walkie talkie or a land line (eg. cable/ADSL/T1) from one end to a robot/machine...that is connected to a wireless modem; any and all devices that can access the robots/machine: The Neural Links can be tied to my patented Multidimensional Internet - collaborative work - Rentable time via internet to our software (eg. Office Suite), hardware (processing power and memory) - And Online Artificial Intelligences; every multidimensional website could be designed to have seamless integration 1. a standard package of Artificial Intelligence, 2. an Artificial Intelligence that is an expert in different areas (Business, family, single personal, bio sciences, chemistry, catered to age and level of education and skills, and occupation and responsibilities required of you - organizing factual information to take segment/areas based on these topics to place in the specific Artificial Intelligence), 3. seamless integration of an exchange of multi Artificial Intelligences (sharing) program between (eg. Physical Gigabyte memories and any and all skills that are plug and play from computer to laptop to television console)... the exchange/sharing program would allow people to interact and teach or ask the Artificial Intelligence research and/or read material and grow their Artificial Intelligence that others can use and/or experience and/or interact with via time share and/or pay for time via Multidimensional Website... We could even have an e-device that does voice command and speech or clip on/and unclip off screens of various sizes for text options (Artificial Intelligence). The Artificial Intelligence could use Gerard Voon's patented Memory Model (clues/connections/representative labels/linkages); especially for people who have memory blocks and/or are forgetful. Or people who are interested in knowledge readily available at any time. Another option is to use Google or for specificity when you want only the facts Wikipedia to be used (seamless integration) by Artificial Intelligence. Wikipedia can be used as a starting point to see if your keywords (representative identities/labels/clues...) refer to the correct topic. Sometimes there are multiple uses for the same keywords and other uses for the same key words are more generically popular. Using Wikipedia (Segmented by: History; Usage; How to Produce; Side Effects...), based on what the person knows and verified that this key word and its topic is covered by this Wikipedia topic, whether the key word is the topic and/or the key word is found in the topic, one can narrow the scope of the search based on the requirements that is wanted as the target of your search). In a new innovative addition to Gerard Voon's patented Multi Screens Computer we can sell optional plug and Haptic interfaces with any or all but not limited to laptop and/or eyeglass screens or other portable screens even a table haptic controlled personal screens. The haptic Multi Screens can enable the person to use a personal screen to zoom in on and select/targets an icon/entity/label/keyword/name/representative. Artificial Intelligence can help people with Managing Memory Using this selection zoom in on technology can operate by using the representations to help person recall via what in the contents covered by the representation/word labels/pictures/objects/entities and their interactions what comes to mind immediately stand out/easily remembered and the Gerard Voon's patented memory model whereby the representation that leads to recall of most easily is remembered (stands out) points, can lead to further points of recognition if not all or most of the information, and if you studied the salient points and its structure location in the organization of the material both in text as well as in logic, and thoroughly understood all functions, relevant (and some irrelevant but easy to remember because it is easy to understand, or makes an memory imprint because it is unique and/or bizarre, linked with an emotional response via interesting - appeal value) relationships/connections/linkages with other material (which can be used for clues). Also there is the sequential placement like a 3 dimensional (we could use Gerard Voon's patented Multidimensional Internet) maps of whereby there is a table of contents, index and glossary, to choose the key word that you want to know more about (or a clue that you recall was connected/linked/connected to the actual targeted keyword), it can list all the times the keyword is used and list its place sequentially; the person can click on one of the place that the key word is used it can list the salient points or information that is relevant or that the person knows is related to the actual targeted keyword and (the Artificial Intelligence) can match keywords to key words...it can show how many salient/relevant points are listed in the chapter; page and/or paragraph and/or sentence or home in directly on the keyword that matches the structural map where the person remembers that the targeted answers were found/located. To convert this structural map into 3 dimensions, we organize the material into representative key entities/objects/pictures/labels in a rooms, by content divided by chapter/topic/paragraph lines anywhere where the keywords are found and also by Gerard Voon's patented memory model (system/parts). These representative key entities/objects/pictures/labels can also be sorted by name (alphabetical and Gerard Voon's patented Word Recognition), original creation date (which can be registered via our Multidimensional Website for Document beginning date (a summary), last/most recently changed (including amounts bytes changed since the pervious change - even records of steps of undo typing between the last/most recent change and the earlier previous saving of the eg. document), type (same type grouped together or in separate rooms), size (can be represented by the size of the entity/object in the room), and/or sort/organize by urgency and/or importance and generic versus customized versus heroes/heroines popularity as well as history (past ranges of time horizon) that is significant, also present and significant whose impacts we may need to plan for. Another option to organize/sort in a Multidimensional Website rooms which hold saved any and all things is to stack the material into representative key names/entities/objects/pictures/labels/interactions/activities, lined up from left to right and top shelf to bottom shelf eg. as top shelf fills from left to right, then stack to the next lower shelf, perhaps saving the bottom shelf for your favourites saved things. Or we could have a 3-dimensional file cabinet(s) the number of file cabinets depends on how many ways you want to sort your segment your files, and how different (eg. different fields and/or or training needed for different occupations and/or different areas of life you may want to keep separate eg professional versus personal). The file cabinet could produce a printable list of representative key entities/objects/pictures/labels which after instructing the way to organize depending what you know and/or believe about the sought answer...We could have Index/Glossaries' to pick representative key entities/objects/pictures - headings/labels any and all identifying markers, as well as option to connect to clues Gerard Voon's patented memory model clues/connections/linkages/relationships outs side the scope of this particular file (there could also be a sections that are secrets eg. secret recipes that you can search within your company's website that where only authorized people can go and is not available on Google), or Multidimensional compartments or even website and even the scope off Google...like key word html links you choose keywords from the Index/Glossary that you think covers the sought information/experience and/or you think is a indirect clue will lead to more knowledge that will lead you to the sought correct/succinct/poignant information/experience (GP; 0.5%) (Jeff 1%). Once the correct word is selected from the index/glossary one can observe (on big articles) which chapter and topics within chapter and which subtopics within topics the words are found (eg. in sub topic how many times the key word is found - even chart it where the page number is the x-axis and the paragraph - and zoom into the line number from top of page to line where the keyword is found is the y-axis...) - really we could create a whole new amalgamated website that Includes most recent and popular or any and all ways of organization/sorting of keywords found in articles and with the tools datamine herein, eg. 1. Index leading to exact place where the key word is found in each and every article, 2. Glossary/Dictionary (for a specific article or more than one or generic dictionary) as to how the word is used for verbal and/or written communications to describe and/or identify succinctly, 3. Encyclopedia as to more in depths in facts of all the data/information/beliefs known about the keyword but limited to overlapping/redundant facts/data/information/beliefs between where a keyword will have an explanation of introduction, history (path impacts from past to now), what it's components are/what categorizations of (eg. science i",
