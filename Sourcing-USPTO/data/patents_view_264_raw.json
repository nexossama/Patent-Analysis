The group study system allows for students to form study groups with other students in the same class or related classes by utilizing various technologies that make such a system possible. The system provides for an anonymous creation of the study sessions and maintains the anonymity until all students joining the study session participate in the study session. These sessions can be in person and virtual. Hybrid and virtual sessions are becoming more and more important with the increasing presence of online education. This system harnesses technology in an innovative way to do something that was not possible years ago by enabling students to gather in a learning environment with other students who previously did not know each other. Additionally, the system operates to allow crowd sourcing of data for the input of exam data, including date and time of the exam in order to automatically extend exam reminders.",

A series of individual digit-defining cutouts present a range of numerals in which each cutout is of a predetermined length corresponding to its numerical value with the cutouts being graduated to progressively increase in length from a numeral denoting a specific low value to a numeral denoting a specific high value. Thus, when a student selects a group of two or more cutouts and places them in an end-to-end relationship such that their accumulated length is equal to that of another cutout representing a base numeral, it will be seen that the sum of their individual values is equal to that of the base numeral. In this manner, not only is the recognition of individual numerals taught, but also, simple arithmetic addition and subtraction concepts can be taught with the learner discovering the answers to simple arithmetic problems through physical experience. Inasmuch as the cutouts have suitable respective widths and thicknesses compatible with their lengths, the three-dimensional configuration of the numerals makes this teaching method and apparatus ideally suited for use in connection with teaching numerical concepts and simple arithmetic in special education classes, such as those for the mentally handicapped or the blind which kinesthetic means of learning are very important.",

The method comprising the steps of: receiving a resource response set of results obtained in response to a current user query and receiving a user context vector associated with the current user query, the user context vector comprising data associating an interaction state with the user; applying an ordering and annotation function for mapping the user context vector with the resource response set to generate an annotated response set having one or more annotations; and, controlling the presentation of the resource response set to the user according to the annotations, wherein the ordering and annotation function is executed interactively at the time of each user query. In an off-line process, a supervised learning algorithm is implemented for receiving user interaction data from among a database of user interaction records and an annotation scoring metric representing a measure of performance in locating resource response results displayed via a graphical interface. The algorithm generates ordering and annotation functions which are adaptable based on history of user interactions as provided in the database of user interaction records. The result of this invention is the ability to drive visualization systems for presenting resource response results in the most beneficial and meaningful way to the user via an interface when performing search and resource selection. The system and method is especially applicable for a self service system in a variety of customer self service domains including education, real estate and travel.",

These activities can generally be divided into passive, active, and recall activities. By deconstructing educational courses into individual concepts, a general model of learning is then applied that connects concepts to the activities undertaken by students to learn those concepts. As a result, a model of learning is developed where courses are atomized into individual learning units, each of which comprises a concept and at least one learning activity.
